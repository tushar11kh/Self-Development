Here’s a **complete guide to building a Docker Compose stack with NGINX and Redis**, with deep conceptual explanations and a practical step-by-step walk-through.

---

## 🔧 Goal

We want to use **Docker Compose** to launch two services:

* **NGINX** – A high-performance reverse proxy / web server.
* **Redis** – An in-memory key-value store, commonly used as a cache or message broker.

They will be containerized and networked together using Docker Compose.

---

## 🧠 Deep Conceptual Understanding

### 🧱 Why Docker Compose?

* Docker Compose allows you to **define and run multi-container Docker applications** using a YAML file.
* It handles **networking**, **volume mounts**, and **environment config** between services.

---

## ⚙️ Services Breakdown

### 1. **NGINX**

* Lightweight web server, reverse proxy, load balancer.
* Can serve static files, or reverse proxy to upstream services (like app servers).

### 2. **Redis**

* An in-memory database supporting strings, hashes, lists, sets, etc.
* Used for:

  * Caching
  * Pub/Sub messaging
  * Session management

---

## 📄 `docker-compose.yml` File

---

## 🔍 Explained in Detail

### ✅ `version: '3.9'`

* Specifies the Compose file format.
* `3.9` is stable and widely supported.

### ✅ `services`

Defines all containers in your stack.

#### nginx:

* `image: nginx:latest` → Pulls the latest official NGINX image.
* `ports: 8080:80` → Redirects traffic from your machine’s port 8080 to container’s port 80 (NGINX default).
* `volumes`:

  * `./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro` → Mount your custom config.
  * `./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro` → Serve static files (like `index.html`).
* `depends_on: redis` → Ensures Redis starts before NGINX.
* `networks: backend` → Both containers share a private Docker network.

##### 🧠 What This Line Means

```yaml
- ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
```

**Split into 3 parts:**

| Part                    | Meaning                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./nginx.conf`          | Path on your **host machine** (relative to `docker-compose.yml`) |
| `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` | Path inside the **NGINX container** (replaces default config)    |
| `:ro`                   | Mount is **read-only** (for safety, NGINX can't modify it)       |

---

#### redis:

* `image: redis:7-alpine` → Alpine-based lightweight Redis.
* `ports: 6379:6379` → Exposes Redis to the host (not always needed unless accessed externally).
* `volumes: redis_data:/data` → Redis persistence.




## 📁 Project Structure

```
nginx-redis-stack/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── nginx.conf
├── html/
│   └── index.html
```

---

## ✍️ Sample `nginx.conf`

This config makes NGINX serve static files and optionally connect to Redis (via a Lua module or upstream app):



---

## 🧪 Running It

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Test:

* Visit `http://localhost:8080` → Should serve `index.html`
* Run `docker exec -it redis_cache redis-cli` → Use the Redis CLI inside container

---

## 🧼 Cleaning Up

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

This removes containers **and** volumes (Redis data).

## 🧠 Extra Concepts You Should Understand

| Concept                     | Why It Matters                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Volumes**                 | Keeps Redis data persistent outside container lifecycle                  |
| **Networks**                | Containers can talk to each other using service names (`redis`, `nginx`) |
| **depends\_on**             | Helps order startup but doesn’t wait for Redis to be fully *ready*       |
| **Stateless vs Persistent** | NGINX is stateless, Redis stores data (persistence is optional)          |
| **Configuration Mounts**    | Allows you to control behavior without rebuilding the image              |

---

## 🧭 What You Can Do Next

1. **Add a backend** like a Go or Node.js app that reads/writes to Redis.
2. Use **Lua in NGINX** to interact directly with Redis (advanced).
3. Add **healthchecks** and proper **logging/monitoring**.
4. Setup a **Docker network bridge** for better service isolation.
5. Use **Redis password** and secure the stack.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: How Redis & NGINX Might Interact?

Direct interaction is **not common** unless you:

* Use **OpenResty** (NGINX with Lua scripting)
* Or use NGINX to reverse proxy to an app that uses Redis

So typically the stack looks like this:

```
Client → NGINX (proxy) → App Server (e.g., Go) ↔ Redis
```
