### SSH server initialization
Install the SSH server: "sudo apt install openssh-server".
Start the SSH service: "sudo systemctl start ssh".
Enable SSH to run on boot: "sudo systemctl enable ssh".
Verify SSH is running: "sudo systemctl status ssh". Look for “active (running)” in the output

###Used the below command to create an user named deployuser1 , 
#where password is disabled and gecos helps to ignore other fields 
#and giving access of a particular folder only  sudo adduser 
#--disabled-password --gecos "" deployuser1

sudo mkdir -p /var/www/myapp
sudo chown -R deployuser:deployuser /var/www/myapp
sudo chmod -R 750 /var/www/myapp -> Owner   group   others
                                      7       5        0

### file permission number and binary 
| Number | Binary | Permissions | Description            |

### command to not give shell access but can transfer files using scp 
sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin deployuser1 

### Set up network
You can fix ip address so that whenever you ssh you don't need to change ip address in command everytime.
Like we did in ubuntu tplink network. 192.168.1.17

###What is ufw?
ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a command-line interface 
to manage iptables—the built-in Linux firewall. It simplifies 
firewall configuration for beginners and admins by providing an easy way to allow, deny, or 
limit network traffic.

🔥 Why use ufw?

    Security: Block unwanted access (e.g., malicious IPs, ports).

    Control: Allow only specific services (e.g., SSH, HTTP).

    Simplicity: Easier than manually editing iptables rules.

✅ Basic Concepts

    Incoming traffic: Connections to your machine.

    Outgoing traffic: Connections from your machine.

    Default policies: What to do when no rule matches (e.g., deny all).

    Rules: Specific permissions or blocks for IPs, ports, or services.


🔹 What is CPU Time?

CPU time refers to the actual time for which a CPU core was actively working 
on a process or task (as opposed to being idle or waiting).
🔸 Types of CPU time:

    User time: Time spent running user-space processes (e.g., your Go app).

    System time: Time spent running kernel-space operations (e.g., system calls, driver operations).

    Idle time: CPU is not doing any task.

    I/O wait: Time spent waiting for I/O (like disk or network).

🔸 How to check it:

Use the top, htop, or vmstat command.

Example from top:

=> %Cpu(s):  5.5 us,  2.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 92.0 id,  0.3 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.2 si,  0.0 st

Here, us is user time, sy is system time, id is idle, wa is I/O wait.

✅ Why it matters (for DevOps/Infra):

    High system time may indicate kernel-level issues or too many syscalls.

    High user time shows CPU-bound processes (like compression or Go computations).

    Helps diagnose performance bottlenecks.

🔹 What is Load Average?

Load average represents the average number of processes waiting for CPU over a period of time.
🔸 Seen using:

uptime
# or
cat /proc/loadavg


Example:

load average: 1.23, 0.75, 0.60

→ These are 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute averages.

🔸 How to interpret:

Compare the numbers against the number of logical CPU cores.

    If you have 4 cores:

        Load average of 4.00 means full capacity.

        Load average of >4.00 = overloaded.

        Load average of <4.00 = under-utilized.

✅ Why it matters:

    Helps in autoscaling decisions on cloud (e.g., AWS EC2 CPU alarms).

    Identifies CPU pressure and queuing of processes.

    Important for alerting in DevOps and observability tools like Prometheus.

    
🔹 Difference Between MemFree and MemAvailable

These come from /proc/meminfo and free -m.

| Metric           | Meaning                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   MemFree        | Total **unallocated** RAM (not used by anything at all)                                      |
|   MemAvailable   | Total memory that is **available for use**, including cache,                                 |
                   |  buffers, and reclaimable memory                                                             |  

🔸 Why is MemAvailable often higher?

Linux uses unused memory as disk cache and buffers to speed up I/O. 
This memory can be reclaimed if needed.
So even if MemFree is low, the system isn’t necessarily low on memory.

🔸 Example:

$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.7G        1.2G        300M        200M        6.2G        6.9G

free: 300MB = very low

available: 6.9GB = system is healthy, because 6.2GB is cache and reclaimable

✅ Why it matters:

    Monitoring tools (like Prometheus node exporter) should use MemAvailable.

    Don’t panic just by looking at low MemFree — Linux is using RAM effectively.

🔧 Cheat Sheet:

| Term         | Meaning                                        | How to Use It                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CPU Time     | How long the CPU was active (user/system time) | Use `top`, `vmstat`, `pidstat`      |
| Load Average | Processes waiting for CPU (1, 5, 15 min)       | Use `uptime`, compare to core count |
| MemFree      | Truly free memory, not used for anything       | Rarely useful in isolation          |
| MemAvailable | Free + cache + reclaimable memory              | Use this for memory health          |

# Linux files
=> /proc/stat: A virtual file in Linux that contains statistics about the system, especially CPU usage.
                It’s updated frequently. The line starting with cpu shows cumulative CPU time since boot,
                broken into different categories.
                Should read -> https://www.linuxhowtos.org/System/procstat.htm

### Point to write .sh/script files
=> #!/bin/bash
Shebang — It tells the system that this script should be run using the Bash shell.
Without this, the system might try to execute it using another shell like sh, which may behave differently.

=> function_name() {}
Defines a function in Bash.
Functions group reusable code. You can call this function anywhere in the script using function_name.
In this script, get_cpu_times is defined and used to extract CPU stats.

=> awk '/^cpu / {print ...}'
awk is a text-processing utility.
It reads /proc/stat, finds the line that starts with cpu (note the space),
and prints columns 2 to 8, which represent CPU time in various modes (user, system, idle, etc.).

=> read -r var1 var2 ...
Reads space-separated input into multiple variables.
-r tells Bash not to treat backslashes (\) as escape characters.
This helps accurately parse the output from commands like awk.

=> < <(command)
This is process substitution.
It runs the command inside the () in a sub-shell and provides its output as a file-like input
to the left-hand side command (such as read).

=> sleep N
Pauses script execution for N seconds.
In this script, sleep 1 gives a 1-second delay between two CPU readings.

=> echo
Prints output to the terminal.
Used here to display the calculated CPU usage percentage.


=> #
Denotes a comment in Bash.
Everything after # on the same line is ignored by the shell.
Useful for explaining what the code is doing.

### Connect SSH to vscode
in config file in .ssh write this:

Host ubuntu-mac
    HostName 192.168.1.17
    User tk
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ubuntu_mac_key
    IdentitiesOnly yes

###SYSTEMD

✅ What is systemd?

systemd is the default init system on most modern Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora). It is responsible for booting the system, managing services, mounting filesystems, and handling processes.
🔧 1. What is an Init System?

An init system is the first process (PID 1) started by the Linux kernel during boot. Its job:

    Set up the system environment

    Start services (like SSH, networking, Docker)

    Manage dependencies between them

    Handle shutdown and reboot

Historically, systems used:

    SysVinit

    Upstart

    Now, mostly systemd

⚙️ 2. Why is systemd Important?

    | Feature                | What it Means                                          |
    | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Parallel Service Start | Speeds up boot by not starting services one by one     |
    | Dependency Mgmt        | Starts services only when their dependencies are ready |
    | Unified Tooling        | `systemctl`, `journalctl`, etc. — consistent interface |
    | Service Monitoring     | Automatically restarts services if they crash          |
    | Logging                | Uses built-in journal (no need for separate syslog)    |


📂 3. Where Is systemd Configured?

    | Type                       | Location                                              |
    | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | Default Unit Files         | `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`                            |
    | Custom/Override Unit Files | `/etc/systemd/system/`                                |
    | Active Services at Boot    | Linked in `/etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/` |


📦 4. What Are systemd Units?

    Units are configuration files that tell systemd how to start/manage something.

    | Unit Type | Purpose                                              | File Extension |
    | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
    | `service` | Defines a system service                             | `.service`     |
    | `target`  | Groups other units (like runlevels)                  | `.target`      |
    | `mount`   | Manages a mount point                                | `.mount`       |
    | `socket`  | Listens for sockets (like systemd-socket activation) | `.socket`      |
    | `timer`   | Cron-like scheduling                                 | `.timer`       |


🔄 5. Boot Process with systemd

Here's what happens during a typical boot:

    Kernel loads and executes /sbin/init → this is a symlink to systemd.

    systemd loads its unit files.

    It looks for its default target (usually default.target, linked to graphical.target or multi-user.target)

    It starts all the services required by that target and its dependencies.

You can view your default boot target with:

systemctl get-default

Common targets:

| Target              | Description                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `multi-user.target` | CLI-only, networking enabled |
| `graphical.target`  | GUI + networking             |
| `rescue.target`     | Single-user mode             |
| `poweroff.target`   | System shutdown              |
| `reboot.target`     | System restart               |

🧩 6. Example: service unit file

File: /etc/systemd/system/foobar.service

[Unit]
Description=Run foobar service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/foobar
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

| Section     | What It Does                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `[Unit]`    | Describes the unit and when to start   |
| `[Service]` | Defines how to start, stop, restart    |
| `[Install]` | Used when enabling service (boot link) |

🛠️ 7. Common systemctl Commands

    | Action                 | Command                                |
    | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | View all running units | `systemctl list-units`                 |
    | Start a service        | `sudo systemctl start nginx.service`   |
    | Stop a service         | `sudo systemctl stop nginx.service`    |
    | Restart a service      | `sudo systemctl restart nginx.service` |
    | View service status    | `systemctl status nginx.service`       |
    | Enable at boot         | `sudo systemctl enable nginx.service`  |
    | Disable at boot        | `sudo systemctl disable nginx.service` |
    | View logs              | `journalctl -u nginx.service`          |

📌 8. Check if You're Using systemd

ps -p 1 -o comm=

Output will be:

systemd

Also, look for:

/usr/lib/systemd/

🧠 9. Key Concepts to Remember

    | Concept            | Meaning                                                |
    | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `systemctl`        | Command-line tool to manage systemd                    |
    | `journalctl`       | Log viewer for systemd services                        |
    | `unit`             | A resource systemd manages (service, mount, socket...) |
    | `target`           | A group of units (like runlevels)                      |
    | `enable`/`disable` | Add/remove from default target                         |
    | `WantedBy`         | Used in `[Install]` section to link service to target  |


💡 10. Pro Tips for DevOps

    📁 Store custom unit files in /etc/systemd/system/

    🛠 After editing a unit, always reload:

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec   # Full reload
sudo systemctl daemon-reload   # Reload unit files

🚀 Want to run a Go/CLI app on boot? Make a .service file!

🔄 Use Restart=on-failure to auto-recover crashed services

🧪 Debug slow boot:

systemd-analyze blame


### using our golang flag_cli tool for systemd

    | Step |    Action                                                 |
    | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 1️⃣   | Build: `go build -o name_of_program_or_service main.go`    |
    | 2️⃣   | Move: `sudo mv name_of_prog /usr/local/bin/`               |
    | 3️⃣   | Create service: `/etc/systemd/system/name_of_prog.service` |
    | 4️⃣   | Enable & start: `systemctl enable/start`                   |
    | 5️⃣   | Monitor: `systemctl status`, `journalctl`                  |

### Format of a .service file

a .service file is a text-based configuration file with three main sections:

    [Unit]      → Metadata and dependencies
    [Service]   → Execution settings (how to run it)
    [Install]   → When to start it (boot-time integration)

=> Sample:

    [Unit]
    Description=My CLI system monitor tool
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mycli --all
    Restart=on-failure

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


=>🔸 Common Unit dependencies:

    network.target — if your service needs networking

    local-fs.target — waits for filesystems to be ready

    syslog.target — if you rely on logging early

=> Most common install values:

    multi-user.target → boots in CLI mode (like runlevel 3)

    graphical.target → boots with GUI

    default.target → usually links to graphical or multi-user
