Q) What is ufw?
ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a command-line interface to manage iptablesâ€”the built-in Linux firewall. It simplifies firewall configuration for beginners and admins by providing an easy way to allow, deny, or limit network traffic.

ðŸ”¥ Why use ufw?

    Security: Block unwanted access (e.g., malicious IPs, ports).

    Control: Allow only specific services (e.g., SSH, HTTP).

    Simplicity: Easier than manually editing iptables rules.

âœ… Basic Concepts

    Incoming traffic: Connections to your machine.

    Outgoing traffic: Connections from your machine.

    Default policies: What to do when no rule matches (e.g., deny all).

    Rules: Specific permissions or blocks for IPs, ports, or services.
